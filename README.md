# Tic Tac Toe

### Summary
The game of Tic Tac Toe is a classic way to low-key practice strategy.  This version is inspired by the late 20th Century graffiti scene; using 
bright, unique colors and a spray can cursor.


### How it Works
- When user visits the website, the main page displays a tic tac toe board in the center and on either side are the player scoreboards.  
- There is a predetermined player 'X' and player 'O'.  And 'X' will always start first.
- The way to win is by collecting 3 squares consecutively; they can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.  The user clicks the square to place their token.
- Once a winner or a draw has been determined, the game board will automatically reset but the wins for each user will persist.
- There is a 'reset score' button there for the user if they would like to play against a new player.

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML

### Future Additions
- Add additional token options so each user can choose their own representation.
- Add a place for the user to enter their name.

### Reflection
#### Challenges
- My main challenge in this project was getting through the logic of the game, primarily tracking the gameboard squares and how to generate a win on each game.
#### Wins
- My main win is that I'm happy with my end result.  I tried to start this project slowly and have a plan set.  I also like the styling additions I had time to impliment.
