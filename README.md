# Tic Tac Toe

### Summary
The game of Tic Tac Toe is a classic way to practice strategy while relaxing.

### How it Works
- When user visits the website, the main page displays a tic tac toe board in the center and on either side are the player scoreboards.  
- There is a predetermined player 'X' and player 'O'.  And 'X' will always start first.
- The way to win is by collecting 3 squares consecutively; they can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.  The user clicks the square to place their token.
- Once a winner or a draw has been determined, the game board will automatically reset so the user can continue to play.

- HTML
- CSS

### Future Additions
